# Predictive Regression Model for Energy Consumption Forecasting

## Project Overview

### Primary Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive regression machine learning model using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data to forecast customer energy consumption. By leveraging load profile clusters, weather information, and bank holiday schedules, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable energy consumption predictions for households in London.

### Background
Traditional electricity utilities are undergoing significant digitization with the implementation of smart grid technologies. As electrification accelerates across various industries—most notably in the automotive sector with the shift to electric vehicles—energy demand and consumption are reaching unprecedented levels. A fundamental challenge facing utilities is the need to balance generational capacity with consumer demand.

Smart grids offer a wealth of demand and consumption data points, which utilities can analyze to estimate and predict energy demand. AMI plays a crucial role in this process, as it records and transmits customer consumption and demand data as load profiles back to utilities. Initially, these load profiles were used solely for billing purposes. However, with advancements in smart metering, additional power quality metrics—including voltage, current, and harmonic data—are now collected and transmitted.

### Objectives
- Develop a predictive regression model using AMI data to forecast energy consumption.
- Integrate weather data and bank holiday schedules to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Provide utilities with insights to manage load and minimize the risk of brownouts.

### Key Components
1. **Data Sources:**
   - AMI data capturing customer load profiles, including historical consumption metrics and power quality data.
   - Weather data to account for environmental factors affecting energy use.
   - Bank holiday schedules to incorporate variations in consumption patterns during holidays.

2. **Methodology:**
   - **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing AMI data, integrating weather and holiday information.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Identifying key features that influence energy consumption, such as time of day, seasonal patterns, and temperature.
   - **Model Development:** Implementing predictive regression algorithms to forecast energy consumption based on historical data.

3. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - Development of a robust predictive model capable of accurately forecasting energy consumption trends for London households.
   - Enhanced decision-making for utilities, leading to better load management and reduced risk of supply disruptions.

### Significance
The successful implementation of this predictive model will empower utilities to better manage energy distribution, improve operational efficiency, and support the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape. By leveraging AMI data and advanced analytics, utilities can not only respond more effectively to changing demand patterns but also contribute to the overall stability of the grid.
